I am currently a PhD student in the A. [Mathis group](https://www.mathislab.org/) at the EPFL. My main goal is to reverse engineer the computational mechanisms that govern the sensorimotor system to improve the control of robots and neuroprostheses. My main interests lie at the intersection between Artificial intelligence and Neuroscience. 

I graduated in Electronic Engineering at the University of Padova (Italy) in 2017 and I finished my M. Sc. in Bionics Engineering jointly organized at the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and Pisa University (Italy) in 2019. Thanks to the Giovanni Armenise Harvard fellowship, I did my master thesis in the [Harvey lab](https://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/) at the Harvard Medical School in collaboration with Professor Stefano Panzeri. Afterwards, I continued the project of my master thesis as research intern in the Neural computation lab at IIT (Rovereto, Italy).
